I am a third-semester student in the Information Technology program, specializing in multiplatform software development. I joined this program because of my passion for programming, which began when I learned the C# language to develop games with Unity. I enjoy delving into the technical aspects of computer development. My hobbies include video games and board games.
                                    In the short term, my goals are to complete the third semester and gain a better understanding of the Japanese language. In this project, my role is that of Operations Director and back-end developer.

                                <p class="text-center">Hello, my name is Abraham. I am currently a student in the Information Technology program at UTCH. I chose this career because of my interest in developing applications or small programs that could make daily tasks easier. This interest grew while I was studying another major, which I eventually left for this one due to both my passion for it and the impact of the pandemic.
                                    Lately, I have been focusing on the integrative project, setting aside personal hobbies such as watching series or playing video games. I've directed my attention to school and, specifically, to the front-end development in this project.

                                    In our project, I have the role of programming the front-end of the website along with my partner Abraham. We are responsible for giving visual details to the page and ensuring that everything is properly arranged. Some of my hobbies include reading, playing board games with family and friends, and enjoying coffee with my girlfriend. Additionally, I am the coordinator of a youth group called "Escuadrón Mohinora," which focuses on promoting youth leadership and seeking a Catholic social impact.
